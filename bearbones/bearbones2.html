  <p>This page is also here to fulfill a requirement. Specifically, the table
    requirement</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>First Column</th>
      <th>Second Column</th>
      <th>Third Column</th>
      <th>Fourth Column</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wow. Tables.</td>
      <td>There's no borders here</td>
      <td>But this *is* a table</td>
      <td>with four columns!</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>I suppose I could try to make the text here bigger, but that would go
    against the theme of the page: give very little effort so I can technically
    check off something I didn't include in my main site.</p>
  <p>Also this graphic is mandatory:</p>
